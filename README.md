# Email Visualisation Project
Email has grown to be a huge part of Digital Forensics and E-discovery. We can connect with others in just a few clicks and information leakage is a common thing in organisations. With several emails sent per day, how can we understand these connections? How can we visualise the type of email individuals have been sending? Can we tell a story somehow with the thousands of emails individuals have sent, received, and deleted? How can we support Digital Forensics and E-discovery? Here are some of my projects.
